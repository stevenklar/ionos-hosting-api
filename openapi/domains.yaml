    # Working with the API
    Every endpoint uses the `X-Api-Key` header for authorization, to obtain the key please see the [Official Documentation](/docs/getstarted).

    The API supports operations through which the customer can retrieve or update data regarding domains or other associated entities such as contacts, nameservers, domain statuses, DNS Security or privacy feature.

    # Support
     Support questions may be posted in English: <a href='/docs/getstarted#support'>API Beta Support</a>.

    Please note that in the Beta phase we offer support in the business Hours Mo-Fri 9:00-17:00 EET.

        The Algorithm field - alg - identifies the public key's cryptographic algorithm and determines the format of the Public Key field
        The DNSKEY, RRSIG, and DS RRs use an 8-bit number to identify the
        security algorithm being used.  These values are stored in the
        "Algorithm number" field in the resource record RDATA.

        Some algorithms are usable only for zone signing (DNSSEC), some only
        for transaction security mechanisms (SIG(0) and TSIG), and some for
        both.  Those usable for zone signing may appear in DNSKEY, RRSIG, and
        DS RRs.  Those usable for transaction security would be present in
        SIG(0) and KEY RRs, as described in [RFC 2931].

      description: |
        The Key Data Interface relies on the use of the <secDNS:keyData>
        element for creates, adds, removes, and <domain:info> responses.  The
        DS information is not provided by the client but is generated by the
        server.  The attributes used for DS generation are based on server
        policy, where only key data is passed between the client and the server.

        The flags field - flags - can have bit 7 of the Flags field is the Zone Key flag.  If bit 7 has value 1,
        then the DNSKEY record holds a DNS zone key, and the DNSKEY RR's
        owner name MUST be the name of a zone.  If bit 7 has value 0, then
        the DNSKEY record holds some other type of DNS public key and MUST
        NOT be used to verify RRSIGs that cover RRsets.

        Bit 15 of the Flags field is the Secure Entry Point flag, described
        in [RFC3757].  If bit 15 has value 1, then the DNSKEY record holds a
        key intended for use as a secure entry point.  This flag is only
        intended to be a hint to zone signing or debugging software as to the
        intended use of this DNSKEY record; validators MUST NOT alter their
        behavior during the signature validation process in any way based on
        the setting of this bit.  This also means that a DNSKEY RR with the
        SEP bit set would also need the Zone Key flag set in order to be able
        to generate signatures legally.  A DNSKEY RR with the SEP set and the
        Zone Key flag not set MUST NOT be used to verify RRSIGs that cover RRsets.
        Bits 0-6 and 8-14 are reserved: these bits MUST have value 0 upon
        creation of the DNSKEY RR and MUST be ignored upon receipt.

        The Algorithm field - alg - identifies the public key's cryptographic algorithm and determines the format of the Public Key field
        The DNSKEY, RRSIG, and DS RRs use an 8-bit number to identify the

        - Domains
      description: |
        Returns a list of all the domains on all customer's contracts.

        The response is paginated and it contains a total count and a list of domains with maximum size equal to the 'limit' parameter value (if not set explicitly, limit takes the default value - see paramters description).
        The number of items to be skipped from the result list can be set by using the 'offset' parameter (default value is 0 - see parameters description).
        The domains retrieved have a small representation which contains only id, name, tld and encodedName in case of IDN domain names.

        The response list can be filtered by setting the query paramters mentioned below.

      description: |
        Returns the locally stored contact details of a domain for registrant, technical and administrative contacts.
        This means that this contact data may be different at the registry depending on the privacy settings of the domain. For Private Registration active, customer's real data is not sent at the registry, being replaced with predefined IONOS privacy data.

        Note: For each contact there is specified a field ('type') which indicates what type of data a contact has. This can be 'USER_DATA' or 'HOSTMASTER'.
          'USER_DATA' indicates customer contact details, while 'HOSTMASTER' contacts have IONOS predefined data and may appear only on the technical contact section.

        Contacts may have different types of extenstions. Possible values can be seen below:

      description: |
        Update domain's contacts.

        Supports updates on different kinds of contacts on the same request (registrant, technical, admin), but only with 'USER_DATA' type.
        The fields are validated and in case of invalid formats an error will be returned.
        Full data is required as per individual contact section (registrant, technical, admin), but specifying all three sections is not mandatory (only the ones which are wanted to be updated can be sent on the request, the rest can be omitted).
        Some TLDs do not support all three contact types. In this case, if an unsupported contact type is sent on the request body, it will be ignored.
        In case of gTLDs, when registrant email is changed, an email verification process will pe triggered and the contact update will be successfully finished only if the new email address is confirmed as valid by clicking the activation link received in inbox.
        If Privacy is enabled, only IONOS internal record of contact data is updated. Contact data at the registry remains the same, as Privacy feature remains active.

        - OWNER_CHANGE_LOCK - intent for clientTransferProhibited; it is set on the domain after some registrant contact data is changed (e.g. name, organization, e-mail) and it is automatically removed after 60 days.
        - DOMAINS_GUARD_LOCK - intent for clientTransferProhibited, clientUpdateProhibited, clientDeleteProhibited; it is set on the domain if it has Domain Guard activated.

        Also, other intents can be set if there is any suspicious abusive activity detected on the domain.

        Statuses can be added, updated or removed using this endpoint.
        Possible status which can be modified are:
        - clientDeleteProhibited
        - clientHold
        - clientRenewProhibited
        - clientTransferProhibited
        - clientUpdateProhibited

        For each status, a set of reasons with intent can be provided by the customer in order to give details about the necessity of that specific status. If not provided, the intent will be autocompleted with 'client_request'.

        There are some intents managed by the IONOS platform such as:
        - EMAIL_VERIFICATION_EXPIRED - intent for clientTransferProhibited; it is set on the domain after 14 days if the client does not confirm that the e-mail address is valid by clicking the activation link received in inbox.

        Also, other intents can be set if there is any suspicious abusive activity detected on the domain.

        For removing a status from the domain, customer can do this operation by setting the 'value' field to false and also giving the entire set of reasons for that specific status. If a status has multiple reasons attached and customer tries to disable it without specifying all the reasons, the status will still remain set on the domain.

        Update DNSSec information on the domain.

        Allowed only when DNS Security feature is supported by the registry and only for custom nameservers (nameservers which are not managed by IONOS platform).
        For instance, if the domain has any IONOS default nameservers a DNSSec update will not be permitted.

        The DNSSec interface supported for each TLD can be dsData or keyData, depending on the registry.
        If the interface supported for a certain TLD is unknown, dsData can be sent with its associated keyData as a child object. So that way, the update will be successful regardless of the supported interface of the registry.

        If the customer wants to remove any key, he can request a DNSSec update with that key omitted. Moreover, he has the posibility to remove all DNSSec data, by sending an empty 'secDns' object.

      description: |
        Returns information about a previously submitted request.

        A request can be in one of the following states:
        - PENDING (immediately after the request passes validation)
        - RUNNING (after an update process has started)
        - EMAIL_VERIFICATION_PENDING (in case there is a contact email update which is waiting to be verified)*
        - EMAIL_VERIFICATION_SUCCESS (immediately after the email address is confirmed to be valid)*
        - FINISHED/FAILED/CANCELLED (in case of successful, unsuccessful or cancelled update processes)

        Note* when there are changes regarding a contact's email address, an activation link will be sent on that email address waiting to be confirmed by the user. If this does not happen, the contact update process will fail, showing on 'details' an 'Email verification timeout' as reason for the failure.
